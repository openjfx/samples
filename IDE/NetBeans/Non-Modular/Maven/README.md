## Non-modular samples for NetBeans

JavaFX 12 samples to run from NetBeans with different options and build tools

Version NetBeans [11.1](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb111/nb111.html)

Download an appropriate [JDK 12](https://jdk.java.net/12/) for your operating system. Make sure `JAVA_HOME` 
is properly set to the Java 12 installation directory. 

The samples assume NetBeans 11 runs on JDK 12 (this can be set editing the `etc/netbeans.conf` file
and setting `netbeans_jdkhome="/path/to/jdk12"`).

### Maven

Clone the sample, open it with NetBeans and reload the POM. Clean, build and run
from the NetBeans usual buttons.
